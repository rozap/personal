Made a little app to help folks learn music by ear. I stopped cultivating my mp3 library, and as a result didn't have the ability to drop songs that I wanted to learn into audacity to slow them down. I wanted the ability to take a youtube video and slow it down and make loops, so I made an app that does that. It's called [μsic.space](http://usic.space).
